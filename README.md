# Little-Space-2
Make School &amp; Personal | MOB 2-2 | Final &amp; Personal Project

### Overall Vision for the Game:
To recreate an old project and recreate the classic game asteroid. The objective is to last as long as possible and try and get the most points in a single round. You will have 3 lives for the entire game, as well as a shield that can take a few hits.

### Target Audience:
All ages, though mostly to those who are into the revamped retro ideas. Taking from its core inspiration, I want to recreate the classic and very simple feel of a classic game in a way that anyone can join.

### Platform:
This will be a mobile platform game that will utilize 3 touch controls at best for the game.

### Genre:
Action - Infinite Screen

### Visual Style
The core style will be the fact that it is 2D. The main visual themes behind the game are gonna be space themed primarily, with spaceships, meteors, asteroids, aliens and what not. Designs are to be kept simple, but still appealing to the user. A less is more type of vibe
