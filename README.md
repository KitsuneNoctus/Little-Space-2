# Little-Space-2
Make School &amp; Personal | MOB 2-2 | Final &amp; Personal Project

### Overall Vision for the Game:
> To recreate an old project and recreate the classic game asteroid. The objective is to last as long as possible and try and get the most points in a single round. You will have 3 lives for the entire game, as well as a shield that can take a few hits.

(Updated) Now a space themed tower shooter game. Your ships engine failed and now your stranded. Last as long as you can amid the meteor fields and rack up points. Be Careful! You can only take 3 hits.
